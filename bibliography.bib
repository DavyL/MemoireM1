abstract = {In this article, we develop a general method for constructing wavelets {|detAj|1/2ψ(Ajx−xj,k):j∈J,k∈K} on irregular lattices of the form X={xj,k∈Rd:j∈J,k∈K}, and with an arbitrary countable family of invertible d×d matrices {Aj∈GLd(R):j∈J} that do not necessarily have a group structure. This wavelet construction is a particular case of general atomic frame decompositions of L2(Rd) developed in this article, that allow other time frequency decompositions such as nonharmonic Gabor frames with nonuniform covering of the Euclidean space Rd. Possible applications include image and video compression, speech coding, image and digital data transmission, image analysis, estimations and detection, and seismology.}

    abstract = "{The Radon transform (RT) suffers from the typical problems of loss of resolution and aliasing that arise as a consequence of incomplete information, including limited aperture and discretization. Sparseness in the Radon domain is a valid and useful criterion for supplying this missing information, equivalent somehow to assuming smooth amplitude variation in the transition between known and unknown (missing) data. Applying this constraint while honoring the data can become a serious challenge for routine seismic processing because of the very limited processing time available, in general, per common midpoint. To develop methods that are robust, easy to use and flexible to adapt to different problems we have to pay attention to a variety of algorithms, operator design, and estimation of the hyperparameters that are responsible for the regularization of the solution.In this paper, we discuss fast implementations for several varieties of RT in the time and frequency domains. An iterative conjugate gradient algorithm with fast Fourier transform multiplication is used in all cases. To preserve the important property of iterative subspace methods of regularizing the solution by the number of iterations, the model weights are incorporated into the operators. This turns out to be of particular importance, and it can be understood in terms of the singular vectors of the weighted transform. The iterative algorithm is stopped according to a general cross validation criterion for subspaces. We apply this idea to several known implementations and compare results in order to better understand differences between, and merits of, these algorithms.}",

abstract = {Purpose: This article considers the problem of reconstructing cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images from a set of undersampled and potentially noisy projection measurements. Methods: The authors cast the reconstruction as a compressed sensing problem based on norm minimization constrained by statistically weighted least-squares of CBCT projection data. For accurate modeling, the noise characteristics of the CBCT projection data are used to determine the relative importance of each projection measurement. To solve the compressed sensing problem, the authors employ a method minimizing total-variation norm, satisfying a prespecified level of measurement consistency using a first-order method developed by Nesterov. Results: The method converges fast to the optimal solution without excessive memory requirement, thanks to the method of iterative forward and back-projections. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a series of digital and experimental phantom studies. It is found a that high quality CBCT image can be reconstructed from undersampled and potentially noisy projection data by using the proposed method. Both sparse sampling and decreasing x-ray tube current (i.e., noisy projection data) lead to the reduction of radiation dose in CBCT imaging. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that compressed sensing outperforms the traditional algorithm when dealing with sparse, and potentially noisy, CBCT projection views.},

We suppose that the columns of Φ are normalized to the unit 𝓁2-norm, and we place uniform measure on such Φ. We prove the existence of ρ = ρ(τ) > 0 so that for large n and for all Φ's except a negligible fraction, the following property holds: For every y having a representation y = Φx0 by a coefficient vector x0 ∈ ℝm with fewer than ρ · n nonzeros, the solution x1 of the 𝓁1-minimization problem \$\${\rm min} \|x\|\_{1} \;\;{subject \; to}\;\; \Phi x = y\$\$ is unique and equal to x0. In contrast, heuristic attempts to sparsely solve such systems—greedy algorithms and thresholding—perform poorly in this challenging setting. The techniques include the use of random proportional embeddings and almost-spherical sections in Banach space theory, and deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of random Wishart matrices. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Given m randomly selected samples of Ux0, where U is an orthonormal matrix, we show that ℓ1 minimization recovers x0 exactly when the number of measurements exceeds where S is the number of nonzero components in x0 and μ is the largest entry in U properly normalized: . The smaller μ is, the fewer samples needed. The result holds for ‘most’ sparse signals x0 supported on a fixed (but arbitrary) set T. Given T, if the sign of x0 for each nonzero entry on T and the observed values of Ux0 are drawn at random, the signal is recovered with overwhelming probability. Moreover, there is a sense in which this is nearly optimal since any method succeeding with the same probability would require just about as many samples.}
